      <p>AMERICA, filling the present with greatest deeds and problems, cheerfully accepting the
        past, including Feudalism, (as, indeed, the present is but the legitimate birth of the
        past, including feudalism,) counts, as I reckon, for her justification and success, (for
        who, as yet, dare claim success?) almost entirely on the future. Nor is that hope
        unwarranted. To-day, ahead, though dimly yet, we see, in vistas, a copious, sane,
        gigantic offspring.</p>
      
      <p>For our New World I consider far less important for what it has
        done, or what it is, than for results to come. Sole among nationalities, These States
        have assumed the task to put in forms of lasting power and practicality, on areas of
        amplitude rivaling the operations of the physical kosmos, the moral and political
        speculations of ages, long, long deferred, the Democratic Republican principle, and the
        theory of development and perfection by voluntary standards, and self-suppliance. Who
        else, indeed, except the United States, in history, so far, have accepted in unwitting faith, and, as we now see,
        stand, act upon, and go security for, these things?</p>
      
      <!-- How do we account for this extra space? KM -->
      
      <p>But let me strike at once the key-note of my purpose in the following strain. First
        premising that, though the passages of it have been written at widely different times,
        (it is, in fact, a collection of memoranda, perhaps for future designers,
        comprehenders,) and though it may be open to the charge of one part contradicting
        another&#8212;for there are opposite sides to the great question of Democracy, as to
        every great question&#8212;I feel

        the parts harmoniously blended in my own
        realization and convictions, and present them to be read only in such oneness, each page
        modified and tempered by the others. Bear in mind, too,
        that they are not the result of studying up in political economy, but of the ordinary
        sense, observing, wandering among men, These States, these stirring years of war and
        peace. I will not gloss over the appaling dangers of universal suffrage in the United
        States. In fact, it is to admit and face these dangers I am writing. To him or her
        within whose thought rages the battle, advancing, retreating, between Democracy's
        convictions, aspirations, and the People's crudeness, vice, caprices, I mainly write
        this book.</p> 
      
      <p>I shall use the words America and Democracy as convertible terms. Not an
        ordinary one is the issue. The United States are destined either to surmount the
        gorgeous history of Feudalism, or else prove the most tremendous failure of time. Not
        the least doubtful am I on any prospects of their material success. The triumphant
        future of their business, geographic, and productive departments, on larger scales and
        in more varieties than ever, is certain. In those respects the Republic must soon (if
        she does not already) outstrip all examples hitherto afforded, and dominate the
        world.<ref xml:id="r1" target="#n1"><metamark function="link">*</metamark></ref></p>
