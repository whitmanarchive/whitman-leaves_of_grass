               <span class="tei_l">T<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">URN</span>, O Libertad, for the war is over,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">(From it and all henceforth expanding, doubting no <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>more, resolute, sweeping the world,)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Turn from lands retrospective, recording proofs of the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>past;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">From the singers that sing the trailing glories of the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>past;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">From the chants of the feudal world—the triumphs of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>kings, slavery, caste;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Turn to the world, the triumphs reserv'd and to come— <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>give up that backward world;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Leave to the singers of hitherto—give them the trailing <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>past;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">But what remains, remains for singers for you—wars <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>to come are for you;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">(Lo! how the wars of the past have duly inured to you <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>—and the wars of the present also inure:)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">—Then turn, and be not alarm'd, O Libertad—turn <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>your undying face,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">To where the future, greater than all the past,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Is swiftly, surely preparing for you.</span>
            </span>
