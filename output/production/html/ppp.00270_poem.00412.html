               <span class="tei_l">SPIRIT whose work is done! spirit of dreadful hours!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Ere, departing, fade from my eyes your forests of bayo-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>nets;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts, (yet onward ever <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>unfaltering pressing;)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Spirit of many a solemn day, and many a savage scene! <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>Electric spirit!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">That with muttering voice, through the war now closed, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>like a tireless phantom flitted,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Rousing the land with breath of flame, while you beat <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and beat the drum;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">—Now, as the sound of the drum, hollow and harsh to <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the last, reverberates round me;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">As your ranks, your immortal ranks, return, return <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>from the battles;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">While the muskets of the young men yet lean over their <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>shoulders;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">While I look on the bayonets bristling over their shoul-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ders;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">While those slanted bayonets, whole forests of them, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>appearing in the distance, approach and pass <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>on, returning homeward,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Moving with steady motion, swaying to and fro, to the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>right and left,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Evenly, lightly rising and falling, as the steps keep <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>time:</span>
               <span class="tei_l">—Spirit of hours I knew, all hectic red one day, but <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>pale as death next day;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Touch my mouth, ere you depart—press my lips close!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Leave me your pulses of rage! bequeath them to me! <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>fill me with currents convulsive!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Let them scorch and blister out of my chants, when you <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>are gone;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Let them identify you to the future, in these songs.</span>
