               <span class="tei_l">The proud black ships of Manhattan, arriving, some <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>fill'd with immigrants, some from the isthmus <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>with cargoes of gold;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Songs thereof would I sing—to all that hitherward <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>comes would I welcome give;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And you would I sing, fair stripling! welcome to you <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>from me, sweet boy of England!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Remember you surging Manhattan's crowds, as you <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>pass'd with your cortege of nobles?</span>
               <span class="tei_l">There in the crowds stood I, and singled you out with <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>attachment;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I know not why, but I loved you…(and so go forth <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>little song,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Far over sea speed like an arrow, carrying my love all <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>folded,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And find in his palace the youth I love, and drop these <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>lines at his feet;)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">—Nor forget I to sing of the wonder, the ship as she <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>swam up my bay,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Well-shaped and stately the Great Eastern swam up my <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>bay, she was 600 feet long,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Her, moving swiftly, surrounded by myriads of small <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>craft, I forget not to sing;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">—Nor the comet that came unannounced, out of the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>north, flaring in heaven;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Nor the strange huge meteor procession, dazzling and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>clear, shooting over our heads,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">(A moment, a moment long, it sail'd its balls of un-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>earthly light over our heads,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Then departed, dropt in the night, and was gone;)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">—Of such, and fitful as they, I sing—with gleams from <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>them would I gleam and patch these chants;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Your chants, O year, all mottled with evil and good! <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>year of forebodings! year of the youth I love!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Year of comets and meteors transient and strange!—lo! <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>even here, one equally transient and strange!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">As I flit through you hastily, soon to fall and be gone, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>what is this book,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">What am I myself but one of your meteors?</span>
