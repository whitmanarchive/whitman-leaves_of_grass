            <span class="tei_l tei_l_n_1">I <span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">SAW</span> old General at bay;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">(Old as he was, his grey eyes yet shone out in battle <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>like stars;)</span>
            <span class="tei_l">His small force was now completely hemmed in, in his <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>works;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">He call'd for volunteers to run the enemy's lines—a <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>desperate emergency;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">I saw a hundred and more step forth from the ranks— <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>but two or three were selected;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">I saw them receive their orders aside—they listen'd <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>with care—the adjutant was very grave;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">I saw them depart with cheerfulness, freely risking their <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>lives.</span>
         </span>
