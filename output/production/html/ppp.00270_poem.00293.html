               <span class="tei_l">Now transmuted, we swiftly escape, as Nature escapes;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are Nature—long have we been absent, but now we <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>return;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We become plants, leaves, foliage, roots, bark;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are bedded in the ground—we are rocks;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are oaks—we grow in the openings side by side;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We browse—we are two among the wild herds, spon-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>taneous as any;</span>

               <span class="tei_l">We are two fishes swimming in the sea together;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are what the locust blossoms are—we drop scent <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>around the lanes, mornings and evenings;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are also the coarse smut of beasts, vegetables, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>minerals;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are two predatory hawks—we soar above, and look <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>down;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are two resplendent suns—we it is who balance <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ourselves, orbic and stellar—we are as two <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>comets;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We prowl fang'd and four-footed in the woods—we <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>spring on prey;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are two clouds, forenoons and afternoons, driving <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>overhead;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are seas mingling—we are two of those cheerful <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>waves, rolling over each other, and interwetting <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>each other;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are what the atmosphere is, transparent, receptive, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>pervious, impervious:</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are snow, rain, cold, darkness—we are each product <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and influence of the globe;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We have circled and circled till we have arrived home <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>again—we two have;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We have voided all but freedom, and all but our own <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>joy.</span>
