               <span class="tei_l">Y<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">EARS</span> of the modern! years of the unperform'd!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Your horizon rises, I see it parting away for more august dramas,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I see not America only, not only Liberty's nation but other nations <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>preparing,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I see tremendous entrances and exits, new combinations, the soli-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>darity of races,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I see that force advancing with irresistible power on the world's <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>stage,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">(Have the old forces, the old wars, played their parts? are the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>acts suitable to them closed?)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I see Freedom, completely arm'd and victorious and very haughty, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>with Law on one side and Peace on the other,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">A stupendous trio all issuing forth against the idea of caste;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">What historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach?</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I see men marching and countermarching by swift millions,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies broken,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I see the landmarks of European kings removed,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I see this day the People beginning their landmarks, (all others <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>give way;)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Never were such sharp questions ask'd as this day,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Never was average man, his soul, more energetic, more like a God,</span>

               <span class="tei_l">Lo, how he urges and urges, leaving the masses no rest!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">His daring foot is on land and sea everywhere, he colonizes the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>Pacific, the archipelagoes,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">With the steamship, the electric telegraph, the newspaper, the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>wholesale engines of war,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">With these and the world-spreading factories he interlinks all <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>geography, all lands;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">What whispers are these O lands, running ahead of you, passing <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>under the seas?</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Are all nations communing? is there going to be but one heart to <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the globe?</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Is humanity forming en-masse? for lo, tyrants tremble, crowns <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>grow dim,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine war,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">No one knows what will happen next, such portents fill the days <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and nights;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Years prophetical! the space ahead as I walk, as I vainly try to <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>pierce it, is full of phantoms,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">This incredible rush and heat, this strange ecstatic fever of dreams <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>O years!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Your dreams O years, how they penetrate through me! (I know <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>not whether I sleep or wake;)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The perform'd America and Europe grow dim, retiring in shadow <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>behind me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The unperform'd, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>me.</span>
