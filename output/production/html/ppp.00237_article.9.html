                  <p class="tei_p">We were attracted by the very singular title of the work, to seek the work itself, and what we
thought ridiculous in the title is eclipsed in the pages of this heterogeneous mass of bombast,
egotism, vulgarity, and nonsense. The beastliness of the author is set forth in his own description
of himself, and we can conceive no better reward than the lash for such a violation of decency as
