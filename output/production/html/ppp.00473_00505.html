               <span class="tei_l tei_l_n_1">O<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">F</span> him I love day and night, I dream'd I heard he was <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>dead; </span>
               <span class="tei_l">And I dream'd I went where they had buried him I love <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>—but he was not in that place; </span>
               <span class="tei_l">And I dream'd I wander'd, searching among burial-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>places, to find him; </span>
               <span class="tei_l">And I found that every place was a burial-place;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The houses full of life were equally full of death, (this <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>house is now;)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The streets, the shipping, the places of amusement, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, the Manna-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>hatta, were as full of the dead as of the living,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And fuller, O vastly fuller, of the dead than of the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>living; </span>
               <span class="tei_l">—And what I dream'd I will henceforth tell to every <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>person and age,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And I stand henceforth bound to what I dream'd;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And now I am willing to disregard burial-places, and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>dispense with them; </span>
               <span class="tei_l">And if the memorials of the dead were put up indif-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ferently everywhere, even in the room where I <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>eat or sleep, I should be satisfied; </span>
               <span class="tei_l">And if the corpse of any one I love, or if my own <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>corpse, be duly render'd to powder, and pour'd <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>in the sea, I shall be satisfied; </span>
               <span class="tei_l">Or if it be distributed to the winds, I shall be sat-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>isfied.</span>
