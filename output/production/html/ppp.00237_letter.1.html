                     <span class="tei_salute">DEAR SIR—</span>
                  </span>
                  <p class="tei_p">I am not blind to the worth of the wonderful gift of "L<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">EAVES OF</span> G<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">RASS</span>." I find it
the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed. I am very
happy in reading it, as great power makes us happy. It meets the demand I am always making of
what seemed the sterile and stingy nature, as if too much handiwork, or too much lymph in the
temperament, were making our western wits fat and mean.</p>
                  <p class="tei_p">I give you joy of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things
said incomparably well, as they must be. I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and
which large perception only can inspire.</p>
                  <p class="tei_p">I greet you at the beginning of a great career, which yet must have had a long foreground
somewhere, for such a start. I rubbed my eyes a little, to see if this sunbeam were no illusion; but
the solid sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and
encouraging.</p>
                  <p class="tei_p">I did not know until I last night saw the book advertised in a newspaper that I could trust the
name as real
