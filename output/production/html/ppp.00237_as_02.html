                        <span class="tei_l">And wring from them their meanings. As King Saul </span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Called up the buried prophet from his grave </span>
                        <span class="tei_l">To speak his doom, so shall this Poet-king </span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Call up the dread past from its awful grave </span>
                        <span class="tei_l">To tell him of our future. As the air </span>

                        <span class="tei_l">Loving mankind, not peoples. As the lake </span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Reflects the flower, tree, rock, and bending heaven, </span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Shall he reflect our great humanity; </span>
                        <span class="tei_l">And as the young Spring breathes with living breath </span>
                        <span class="tei_l">On a dead branch, till it sprouts fragrantly </span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Green leaves and sunny flowers, shall he breathe life </span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Through every theme he touch, making all Beauty </span>
                        <span class="tei_l">And Poetry forever like the stars. (<span class="tei_name tei_name_xml:id_as" data-xmlid="as"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Alexander Smith</span></span>.) </span>
