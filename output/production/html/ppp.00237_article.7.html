                  </h5>
                  <p class="tei_p">We have too long overlooked in this country the great poet who has recently arisen in America,
of whom some of his countrymen speak in connection with Bacon and Shakspeare, whom others
compare with Tennyson—much to the disadvantage of our excellent laureate—and to whom Mr. Emerson writes that he finds in his book "incomparable things, said incomparably well." The
book he pronounces "the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet
contributed;" at which, indeed, says Mr. Emerson in the printed letter sent to us—"I
rubbed my eyes a little, to see if this sunbeam were no illusion."</p>
                  <p class="tei_p">No illusion truly is Walt Whitman, the new American prodigy, who, as he is himself candid
enough to intimate, sounds his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world. He is described by one
of his own local papers as "a tenderly, affectionate, rowdyish, contemplative, sensual, moral,
susceptible, and imperious person," who aspires to cast some of his own grit, whatever that may
be, into literature. We have ourselves been disposed to think there is in literature grit enough,
according to the ordinary sense, but decidedly Walt Whitman tosses in some more. The author
describes himself as "one of the roughs, a kosmos;" indeed, he seems to be very much impressed
with the fact that he is a kosmos, and repeats it frequently. A kosmos we may define, from the
portrait of it on the front of the book, as a gentleman in his shirt-sleeves, with one hand in a
pocket of his pantaloons, and his wide-awake cocked with a dammee-sir air over his
forehead.</p>
                  <p class="tei_p">On the other hand, according to an American review that flatters Walt Whitman, this kosmos is
"a compound of the New England transcendentalist and New York rowdy."</p>
                  <p class="tei_p">But as such terms of compliment may not be quite clear to English readers, we must be content,
in simpler fashion, to describe to them this Brooklyn boy as a wild Tupper of the West. We can
describe him perfectly by a few suppositions. Suppose that Mr. Tupper had been brought up to
the business of an auctioneer, then banished to the backwoods, compelled to live for a long time
as a backwoodsman, and thus contracting a passion for the reading of Emerson and Carlyle?
Suppose him maddened by this course of

reading, and fancying himself not only an Emerson but a Carlyle and an American Shakspeare to
boot when the fits come on, and putting forth his notion of that combination in his own
self-satisfied way, and in his own wonderful cadences? In that state he would write a book
exactly like Walt Whitman's "L<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">EAVES OF</span> G<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">RASS</span>."</p>
                  <p class="tei_p tei_p_rend_center">(<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Extracts and Interlineated remarks</span>.)</p>
                  <p class="tei_p">We must be just to Walt Whitman in allowing that he has one positive merit. His verse has a
purpose. He desires to assert the pleasure that a man has in himself, his body and its sympathies,
his mind (in a lesser degree, however) and its sympathies. He asserts man's right to express his
delight in animal enjoyment, and the harmony in which he should stand, body and soul, with
fellow-men and the whole universe. To express this, and to declare that the poet is the highest
manifestation of this, generally also to suppress shams, is the purport of these "L<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">EAVES OF</span> G<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">RASS</span>." Perhaps it might have been done as well, however, without being always so purposely
obscene, and intentionally foulmouthed, as Walt Whitman is.</p>
                  <p class="tei_p tei_p_rend_center">(<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Extracts and Interlineations</span>.)</p>
                  <p class="tei_p">In the construction of our artificial Whitman, we began with the requirement that a certain
philosopher should have been bred to the business of an auctioneer. We must add now, to
complete the imitation of Walt Whitman, that the wild philosopher and poet, as conceived by us,
should be perpetually haunted by the delusion that he has a catalogue to make. Three-fourths of
Walt Whitman's book is poetry as catalogues of auctioneers are poems. Whenever any general
term is used, off the mind wanders on this fatal track, and an attempt is made to specify all lots
included under it. Does Walt Whitman speak of a town, he is at once ready with pages of town
lots. Does he mention the American country, he feels bound thereupon to draw up a list of barns,
waggons, wilds, mountains, animals, trees, people, "a Hoosier, a Badger, a Buckeye, a
Louisianian, or Georgian, a poke-easy from sand-hills and pines,"
&amp;c., &amp;c. We will give an
illustration of this form of lunacy. The subject from which the patient starts off is equivalent to
things in general, and we can spare room only for half the catalogue. It will be enough, however,
to show how there

arises catalogue within catalogue, and how sorely the paroxysm is aggravated by the incidental
mention of any one particular that is itself again capable of subdivision into lots.</p>

After all, we are not sure whether the poetry of that excellent Mr. Good, the auctioneer who, at
his Great Room, No. 121 Fleet Street, sold the household furniture of Oliver Goldsmith in the
summer of 1774, does not transcend in wisdom and in wit "the most extraordinary piece of wit
and wisdom that" (according to Mr. Emerson) "America has yet contributed."</p>
