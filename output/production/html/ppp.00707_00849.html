                     <span class="tei_l">Lightly strike on the stretch'd tympanum pride and joy in my city,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">How she led the rest to arms, how she gave the cue,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">How at once with lithe limbs unwaiting a moment she sprang,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">(O superb! O Manhattan, my own, my peerless!</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">O strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis! O truer than steel!)</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">How you sprang—how you threw off the costumes of peace with <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>indifferent hand,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">How your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife were <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>heard in their stead,</span>
