               <span class="tei_lg tei_lg_type_linegroup">
                  <span class="tei_l">W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HILE</span> my wife at my side lies slumbering, and the wars are over <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>long,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">And my head on the pillow rests at home, and the vacant mid-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>night passes,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">And through the stillness, through the dark, I hear, just hear, the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>breath of my infant,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">There in the room as I wake from sleep this vision presses upon me;</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">The engagement opens there and then in fantasy unreal,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">The skirmishers begin, they crawl cautiously ahead, I hear the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>irregular snap! snap!</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">I hear the sounds of the different missiles, the short <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">t-h-t! t-h-t!</span> 
                     <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>of the rifle-balls,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">I see the shells exploding leaving small white clouds, I hear the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>great shells shrieking as they pass,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">The grape like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>(tumultuous now the contest rages,)</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">All the scenes at the batteries rise in detail before me again,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">The crashing and smoking, the pride of the men in their pieces,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">The chief-gunner ranges and sights his piece and selects a fuse of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the right time,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">After firing I see him lean aside and look eagerly off to note the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>effect;</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Elsewhere I hear the cry of a regiment charging, (the young <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>colonel leads himself this time with brandish'd sword,)</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">I see the gaps cut by the enemy's volleys, (quickly fill'd up, no <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>delay,)</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">I breathe the suffocating smoke, then the flat clouds hover low <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>concealing all;</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Now a strange lull for a few seconds, not a shot fired on either side,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Then resumed the chaos louder than ever, with eager calls and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>orders of officers,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">While from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ears a shout of applause, (some special success,)</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">And ever the sound of the cannon far or near, (rousing even in <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>dreams a devilish exultation and all the old mad joy in the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>depths of my soul,)</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">And ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions, batteries, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>cavalry, moving hither and thither,</span>
                  <span class="hr">

                  <span class="tei_l">Grime, heat, rush, aide-de-camps galloping by or on a full run,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">With the patter of small arms, the warning <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">s-s-t</span> of the rifles, (these <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>in my vision I hear or see,)</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">And bombs bursting in air, and at night the vari-color'd rockets.</span>
