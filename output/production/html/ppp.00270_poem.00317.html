               <span class="tei_l">O drops of me! trickle, slow drops,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Candid, from me falling—drip, bleeding drops,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">From wounds made to free you whence you were <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>prison'd,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">From my face—from my forehead and lips,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">From my breast—from within where I was conceal'd— <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>press forth, red drops—confession drops;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Stain every page—stain every song I sing, every word <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>I say, bloody drops;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Let them know your scarlet heat—let them glisten;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Saturate them with yourself, all ashamed and wet;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Glow upon all I have written, or shall write, bleeding <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>drops;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Let it all be seen in your light, blushing drops.</span>
