               <span class="tei_l">T<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">O THE</span> garden, the world, anew ascending,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Potent mates, daughters, sons, preluding,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The love, the life of their bodies, meaning and being,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Curious, here behold my resurrection, after slumber;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The revolving cycles, in their wide sweep, having brought <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>me again,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Amorous, mature—all beautiful to me—all wondrous;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">My limbs, and the quivering fire that ever plays through <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>them, for reasons, most wondrous;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Existing, I peer and penetrate still,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Content with the present—content with the past,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">By my side, or back of me, Eve following,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Or in front, and I following her just the same.</span>
            </span>
