                  <h4 class="tei_head tei_head_type_main-authorial">WE TWO, HOW LONG WE WERE FOOL'D.</h4>
                  <span class="tei_lg tei_lg_type_linegroup">
                     <span class="tei_l">W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">E</span> two, how long we were fool'd,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Now transmuted, we swiftly escape as Nature escapes,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">We are Nature, long have we been absent, but now we return,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">We become plants, trunks, foliage, roots, bark,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">We are bedded in the ground, we are rocks,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">We are oaks, we grow in the openings side by side,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">We browse, we are two among the wild herds spontaneous as <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>any,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">We are two fishes swimming in the sea together,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">We are what locust blossoms are, we drop scent around lanes <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>mornings and evenings,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">We are also the coarse smut of beasts, vegetables, minerals,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">We are two predatory hawks, we soar above and look down,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">We are two resplendent suns, we it is who balance ourselves orbic <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and stellar, we are as two comets,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">We prowl fang'd and four-footed in the woods, we spring on <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>prey,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">We are two clouds forenoons and afternoons driving overhead,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">We are seas mingling, we are two of those cheerful waves rolling <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>over each other and interwetting each other,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">We are what the atmosphere is, transparent, receptive, pervious,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>impervious,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">We are snow, rain, cold, darkness, we are each product and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>influence of the globe,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">We have circled and circled till we have arrived home again, we <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>two,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">We have voided all but freedom and all but our own joy.</span>
                  </span>
               </span>
