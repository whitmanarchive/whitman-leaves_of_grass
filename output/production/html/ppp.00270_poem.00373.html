            <span class="tei_l">O<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">F</span> persons arrived at high positions, ceremonies, wealth, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>scholarships, and the like;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">To me, all that those persons have arrived at, sinks <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>away from them, except as it results to their <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>Bodies and Souls,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">So that often to me they appear gaunt and naked;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">And often, to me, each one mocks the others, and mocks <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>himself or herself,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">And of each one, the core of life, namely happiness, is <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>full of the rotten excrement of maggots,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">And often, to me, those men and women pass unwit-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>tingly the true realities of life, and go toward <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>false realities,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">And often, to me, they are alive after what custom has <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>served them, but nothing more,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">And often, to me, they are sad, hasty, unwaked sonnam-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>bules, walking the dusk.</span>
