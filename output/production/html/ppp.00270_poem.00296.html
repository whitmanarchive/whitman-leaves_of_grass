               <span class="tei_l">O<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">NCE</span> I pass'd through a populous city, imprinting my <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>brain, for future use, with its shows, architec-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ture, customs, and traditions;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Yet now, of all that city, I remember only a woman I <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>casually met there, who detained me for love of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>me;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Day by day and night by night we were together,—All <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>else has long been forgotten by me;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I remember, I say, only that woman who passionately <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>clung to me;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Again we wander—we love—we separate again;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Again she holds me by the hand—I must not go!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I see her close beside me, with silent lips, sad and tremu-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>lous.</span>
