               <span class="tei_l">Y<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">OU</span> bards of ages hence! when you refer to me, mind <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>not so much my poems,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Nor speak of me that I prophesied of The States, and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>led them the way of their glories;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">But come, I will take you down underneath this <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>impassive exterior—I will tell you what to say <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>of me:</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the tenderest lover,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The friend, the lover's portrait, of whom his friend, his <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>lover, was fondest,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who was not proud of his songs, but of the measure-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>less ocean of love within him—and freely poured <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>it forth,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who often walked lonesome walks, thinking of his <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>dear friends, his lovers,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who pensive, away from one he loved, often lay sleep-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>less and dissatisfied at night,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>he loved might secretly be indifferent to him,</span>

               <span class="tei_l">Whose happiest days were far away, through fields, in <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>woods, on hills, he and another, wandering hand <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>in hand, they twain, apart from other men,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who oft as he sauntered the streets, curved with his <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>arm the shoulder of his friend—while the arm of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>his friend rested upon him also.</span>
