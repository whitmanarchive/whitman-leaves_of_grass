                     <span class="tei_l">(Know once for all, avow'd on purpose, wherever are men like <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>me, are our lusty lurking masculine poems,)</span>

                     <span class="tei_l">Arms and hands of love, lips of love, phallic thumb of love, breasts <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>of love, bellies press'd and glued together with love,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Earth of chaste love, life that is only life after love,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">The body of my love, the body of the woman I love, the body <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>of the man, the body of the earth,</span>

                     <span class="tei_l">The no-form'd stings that sights, people, objects, sting me with,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">The hubb'd sting of myself, stinging me as much as it ever can <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>any one,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">The sensitive, orbic, underlapp'd brothers, that only privileged <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>feelers may be intimate where they are,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">The curious roamer the hand roaming all over the body, the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>bashful withdrawing of flesh where the fingers soothingly <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>pause and edge themselves,</span>

                     <span class="tei_l">The torment, the irritable tide that will not be at rest,</span>

                     <span class="tei_l">The young man that flushes and flushes, and the young woman <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>that flushes and flushes,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">The young man that wakes deep at night, the hot hand seeking to <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>repress what would master him,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">The mystic amorous night, the strange half-welcome pangs, visions,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>sweats,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">The pulse pounding through palms and trembling encircling <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>fingers, the young man all color'd, red, ashamed, angry;
