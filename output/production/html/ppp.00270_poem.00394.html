               <span class="tei_l">B<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">Y</span> the bivouac's fitful flame,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">A procession winding around me, solemn and sweet and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>slow;—but first I note,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The tents of the sleeping army, the fields' and woods' <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>dim outline,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The darkness, lit by spots of kindled fire—the silence;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The shrubs and trees, (as I left my eyes they seem to <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>be stealthily watching me;)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">While wind in procession thoughts, O tender and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>wondrous thoughts,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Of life and death—of home and the past and loved, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and of those that are far away;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">A solemn and slow procession there as I sit on the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ground,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">By the bivouac's fitful flame.</span>
