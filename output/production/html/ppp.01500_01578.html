               <span class="tei_l">Perennial roots, tall leaves—O the winter shall not <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>freeze you, delicate leaves,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Every year shall you bloom again—Out from where <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>you retired, you shall emerge again;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">O I do not know whether many, passing by, will dis-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>cover you, or inhale your faint odor—but I <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>believe a few will;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">O slender leaves! O blossoms of my blood! I permit <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>you to tell, in your own way, of the heart that is <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>under you,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">O burning and throbbing—surely all will one day be <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>accomplished;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">O I do not know what you mean, there underneath <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>yourselves—you are not happiness,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">You are often more bitter than I can bear—you burn <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and sting me,</span>

               <span class="tei_l">Yet you are very beautiful to me, you faint-tinged <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>roots—you make me think of Death,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Death is beautiful from you—(what indeed is beau-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>tiful, except Death and Love?)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>chant of lovers—I think it must be for Death,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">For how calm, how solemn it grows, to ascend to the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>atmosphere of lovers,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Death or life I am then indifferent—my Soul de-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>clines to prefer,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I am not sure but the high Soul of lovers welcomes <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>death most;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Indeed, O Death, I think now these leaves mean pre-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>cisely the same as you mean;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Grow up taller, sweet leaves, that I may see! Grow <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>up out of my breast!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Spring away from the concealed heart there!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Do not fold yourselves so in your pink-tinged roots,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>timid leaves!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>breast!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Come, I am determined to unbare this broad breast of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>mine—I have long enough stifled and choked;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Emblematic and capricious blades, I leave you—now <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>you serve me not,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Away! I will say what I have to say, by itself,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I will escape from the sham that was proposed to me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I will sound myself and comrades only—I will never <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>again utter a call, only their call,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I will raise, with it, immortal reverberations through <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>The States,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I will give an example to lovers, to take permanent <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>shape and will through The States;</span>

               <span class="tei_l">Through me shall the words be said to make death <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>exhilarating,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Give me your tone therefore, O Death, that I may <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>accord with it,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Give me yourself—for I see that you belong to me <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>now above all, and are folded together above all <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>—you Love and Death are,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>I was calling life,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">For now it is conveyed to me that you are the pur-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ports essential,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">That you hide in these shifting forms of life, for <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>reasons—and that they are mainly for you,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">That you, beyond them, come forth, to remain, the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>real reality,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">That behind the mask of materials you patiently <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>wait, no matter how long,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">That you will one day, perhaps, take control of all,</span>

               <span class="tei_l">But you will last very long.</span>
