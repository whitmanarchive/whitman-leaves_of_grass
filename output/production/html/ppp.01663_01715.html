               <h4 class="tei_head tei_head_type_main-authorial">OF THE TERRIBLE DOUBT OF APPEARANCES.</h4>
               <span class="tei_l">O<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">F</span> the terrible doubt of appearances,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Of the uncertainty after all, that we may be deluded,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">That may-be reliance and hope are but speculations after all,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">That may-be identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">May-be the things I perceive, the animals, plants, men, hills, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>shining and flowing waters,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The skies of day and night, colors, densities, forms, may-be these <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>are (as doubtless they are) only apparitions, and the real <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>something has yet to be known,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">(How often they dart out of themselves as if to confound me and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>mock me!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">How often I think neither I know, nor any man knows, aught of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>them,)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">May-be seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they indeed <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>but seem) as from my present point of view, and might <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>prove (as of course they would) nought of what they <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>appear, or nought anyhow, from entirely changed points <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>of view;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">To me these and the like of these are curiously answer'd by my <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>lovers, my dear friends,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">When he whom I love travels with me or sits a long while holding <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>me by the hand,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">When the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>reason hold not, surround us and pervade us,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom, I am <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>silent, I require nothing further,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I cannot answer the question of appearances or that of identity <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>beyond the grave,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">But I walk or sit indifferent, I am satisfied,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me.</span>
            </span>
