               <span class="tei_l">I <span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">NEED</span> no assurances, I am a man who is pre-occupied of his <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>own soul;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I do not doubt that from under the feet and beside the hands and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>face I am cognizant of, are now looking faces I am not <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>cognizant of, calm and actual faces,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I do not doubt but the majesty and beauty of the world are latent <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>in any iota of the world,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I do not doubt I am limitless, and that the universes are limitless, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>in vain I try to think how limitless,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I do not doubt that the orbs and the systems of orbs play their <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>swift sports through the air on purpose, and that I shall one <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>day be eligible to do as much as they, and more than they,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I do not doubt that temporary affairs keep on and on millions of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>years,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I do not doubt interiors have their interiors, and exteriors have <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>their exteriors, and that the eyesight has another eyesight, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and the hearing another hearing, and the voice another <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>voice,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I do not doubt that the passionately-wept deaths of young men <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>are provided for, and that the deaths of young women and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the deaths of little children are provided for,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">(Did you think Life was so well provided for, and Death, the pur-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>port of all Life, is not well provided for?)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I do not doubt that wrecks at sea, no matter what the horrors of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>them, no matter whose wife, child, husband, father, lover, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>has gone down, are provided for, to the minutest points,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I do not doubt that whatever can possibly happen anywhere at <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>any time, is provided for in the inherences of things,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I do not think Life provides for all and for Time and Space, but I <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>believe Heavenly Death provides for all.</span>
