               <span class="tei_l">T<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HESE</span> I, singing in spring, collect for lovers,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">(For who but I should understand lovers, and all their <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>sorrow and joy?</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And who but I should be the poet of comrades?)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Collecting, I traverse the garden, the world—but <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>soon I pass the gates,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Now along the pond-side—now wading in a little,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>fearing not the wet,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Now by the post-and-rail fences, where the old stones <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>thrown there, picked from the fields, have accu-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>mulated,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Wild-flowers and vines and weeds come up through <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the stones, and partly cover them—Beyond these <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>I pass,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Far, far in the forest, before I think where I get,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Solitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>then in the silence,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Alone I had thought—yet soon a silent troop gathers <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>around me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Some walk by my side, and some behind, and some <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>embrace my arms or neck,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">They, the spirits of friends, dead or alive—thicker <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>they come, a great crowd, and I in the middle,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Collecting, dispensing, singing in spring, there I wan-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>der with them,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Plucking something for tokens—something for these,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>till I hit upon a name—tossing toward whoever <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>is near me,</span>

               <span class="tei_l">Here! lilac, with a branch of pine,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Here, out of my pocket, some moss which I pulled off <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>a live-oak in Florida, as it hung trailing down,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Here, some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>sage,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And here what I now draw from the water, wading in <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the pond-side,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">(O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me—and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>returns again, never to separate from me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And this, O this shall henceforth be the token of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>comrades—this calamus-root shall,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Interchange it, youths, with each other! Let none <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>render it back!)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And twigs of maple, and a bunch of wild orange, and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>chestnut,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And stems of currants, and plum-blows, and the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>aromatic cedar;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">These I, compassed around by a thick cloud of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>spirits,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Wandering, point to, or touch as I pass, or throw them <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>loosely from me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Indicating to each one what he shall have—giving <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>something to each,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">But what I drew from the water by the pond-side, that <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>I reserve,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I will give of it—but only to them that love, as I <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>myself am capable of loving.</span>
