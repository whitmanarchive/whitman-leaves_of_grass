               <h4 class="tei_head tei_head_type_main-authorial">I saw in Louisiana a Live-Oak Growing.</h4>

               <span class="tei_l">I <span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">SAW</span> in Louisiana a live-oak growing,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">All alone stood it, and the moss hung down from the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>branches;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Without any companion it grew there, uttering joyous <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>leaves of dark green,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>myself;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">But I wonder'd how it could utter joyous leaves, stand-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ing alone there, without its friend, its lover near <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>—for I knew I could not;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>upon it, and twined around it a little moss,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And brought it away—and I have placed it in sight in <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>my room;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">(For I believe lately I think of little else than of them;)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Yet it remains to me a curious token—it makes me <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>think of manly love;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>Louisiana, solitary, in a wide flat space,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Uttering, joyous leaves all its life, without a friend, a <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>lover, near,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I know very well I could not.</span>
            </span>
