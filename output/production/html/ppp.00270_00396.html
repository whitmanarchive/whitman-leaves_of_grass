               <span class="tei_l">V<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">IGIL</span> strange I kept on the field one night:</span>
               <span class="tei_l">When you, my son and my comrade, dropt at my side <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>that day,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">One look I but gave, which your dear eyes return'd, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>with a look I shall never forget;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">One touch of your hand to mine, O boy, reach'd up as <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>you lay on the ground;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>battle;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Till late in the night reliev'd, to the place at last again I <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>made my way;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Found you in death so cold, dear comrade—found your <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>body, son of responding kisses, (never again on <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>earth responding;)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Bared your face in the starlight—curious the scene— <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>cool blew the moderate night-wind;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the battle-field spreading;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet, there in the fragrant <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>silent night;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh—Long, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>long I gazed;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Then on the earth partially reclining, sat by your side, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>leaning my chin in my hands;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>you, dearest comrade—Not a tear, not a word;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Vigil of silence, love and death—vigil for you, my son <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and my soldier,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones up-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ward stole;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Vigil final for you, brave boy, (I could not save you, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>swift was your death,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I faithfully loved you and cared for you living—I think <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>we shall surely meet again;)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>dawn appear'd,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>form,</span>

               <span class="tei_l">Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and carefully under feet;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And there and then, and bathed by the rising sun, my <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>son in his grave, in his rude-dug grave I de-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>posited;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Ending my vigil strange with that—vigil of night and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>battle-field dim;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>responding;)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Vigil for comrade swiftly slain—vigil I never forget, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>how as day brighten'd,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I rose from the chill ground, and folded my soldier well <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>in his blanket,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And buried him where he fell.</span>
