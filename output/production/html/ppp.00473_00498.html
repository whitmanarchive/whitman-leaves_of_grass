               <h4 class="tei_head tei_head_type_main-authorial">Of the Terrible Doubt of Appearances.</h4>
               <span class="tei_l tei_l_n_1">
                  O<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">F</span> the terrible doubt of appearances,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Of the uncertainty after all—that we may be deluded,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">That may-be reliance and hope are but speculations <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>after all,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">That may-be identity beyond the grave is a beautiful <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>fable only,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">May-be the things I perceive—the animals, plants, men, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>hills, shining and flowing waters,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The skies of day and night—colors, densities, forms— <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>May-be these are, (as doubtless they are,) only <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>apparitions, and the real something has yet to be <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>known; </span>
               <span class="tei_l">(How often they dart out of themselves, as if to con-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>found me and mock me!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">How often I think neither I know, nor any man knows, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>aught of them;)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">May-be seeming to me what they are, (as doubtless <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>they indeed but seem,) as from my present point <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>of view—And might prove, (as of course they <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>would,) naught of what they appear, or naught <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>anyhow, from entirely changed points of view; </span>
               <span class="tei_l">—To me, these, and the like of these, are curiously <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>answer'd by my lovers, my dear friends; </span>
               <span class="tei_l">When he whom I love travels with me, or sits a long <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>while holding me by the hand,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">When the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>words and reason hold not, surround us and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>pervade us,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>—I am silent—I require nothing further,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I cannot answer the question of appearances, or that <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>of identity beyond the grave; </span>
               <span class="tei_l">But I walk or sit indifferent—I am satisfied,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me.</span>
            </span>
