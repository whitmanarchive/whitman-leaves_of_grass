               <span class="tei_l">T<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">O</span> the leaven'd soil they trod, calling, I sing, for the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>last;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">(Not cities, nor man alone, nor war, nor the dead,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">But forth from my tent emerging for good—loosing, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>untying the tent-ropes;)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">In the freshness, the forenoon air, in the far-stretching <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>circuits and vistas, again to peace restored,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">To the fiery fields emanative, and the endless vistas <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>beyond—to the south and the north;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">To the leaven'd soil of the general western world, to <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>attest my songs,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">(To the average earth, the wordless earth, witness of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>war and peace,)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">To the Alleghanian hills, and the tireless Mississippi,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">To the rocks I, calling, sing, and all the trees in the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>woods,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">To the plain of the poems of heroes, to the prairie <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>spreading wide,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">To the far-off sea, and the unseen winds, and the sane <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>impalpable air;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">…And responding, they answer all, (but not in words,)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The average earth, the witness of war and peace, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>acknowledges mutely;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The prairie draws me close, as the father, to bosom <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>broad, the son;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The Northern ice and rain, that began me, nourish me <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>to the end;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">But the hot sun of the South is to ripen my songs.</span>
            </span>
