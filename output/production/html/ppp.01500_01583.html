               <span class="tei_l">The skies of day and night—colors, densities, forms <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>—May-be these are, (as doubtless they are,) only <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>apparitions, and the real something has yet to be <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>known,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">(How often they dart out of themselves, as if to con-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>found me and mock me!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">How often I think neither I know, nor any man <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>knows, aught of them;)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">May-be they only seem to me what they are, (as <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>doubtless they indeed but seem,) as from my <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>present point of view—And might prove, (as of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>course they would,) naught of what they appear,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>or naught any how, from entirely changed points <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>of view;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">To me, these, and the like of these, are curiously <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>answered by my lovers, my dear friends;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">When he whom I love travels with me, or sits a long <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>while holding me by the hand,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">When the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>words and reason hold not, surround us and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>pervade us,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Then I am charged with untold and untellable wis-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>dom—I am silent—I require nothing further,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I cannot answer the question of appearances, or that <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>of identity beyond the grave,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">But I walk or sit indifferent—I am satisfied,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me.</span>
