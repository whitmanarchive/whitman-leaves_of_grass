               <span class="tei_l">I <span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">NEED</span> no assurances—I am a man who is pre-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>occupied, of his own Soul;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I do not doubt that whatever I know at a given time,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>there waits for me more, which I do not know;</span>
