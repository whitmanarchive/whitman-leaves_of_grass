to her Woolly Horses, her Mermaids, her Sea Serpents, her Barnums, and her Fanny Ferns; but
the last monstrous importation from Brooklyn, New York, has scattered our indifference to the
winds. Here is a thin quarto volume without an author's name on the title-page; but to atone for
which we have a portrait engraved on steel of the notorious individual who is the poet
presumptive. This portrait expresses all the features of the hard democrat, and none of the flexile
delicacy of the civilized poet. The damaged hat, the rough beard, the naked throat, the shirt
exposed to the waist, are each and all presented to show that the man to whom these articles
belong scorns the delicate arts of civilization. The man is the true impersonation of his
book—rough, uncouth, vulgar. It was by the merest accident that we discovered the name of this
erratic and newest wonder; but at page 29 we find that he is —</p>

                  <p class="tei_p">The words "an American" are a surplusage, "one of the roughs" too painfully apparent; but what
is intended to be conveyed by "a kosmos" we cannot tell, unless it means a man who thinks that
the fine essence of poetry consists in writing a book which an American reviewer is compelled to
declare is "not to be read aloud to a mixed audience." We should have passed over this book,
"L<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">EAVES OF</span> G<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">RASS</span>," with indignant contempt, had not some few Transatlantic critics
attempted to "fix" this Walt Whitman as the poet who shall give a new and independent literature
to America—who shall form a race of poets as Banquo's issue formed a line of kings. Is it
possible that the most prudish nation in the world will adopt a poet whose indecencies stink in
the nostrils? We hope not; and yet there is a probability, and we will show why, that this Walt
Whitman will not meet with the stern rebuke which he so richly deserves. America has felt,
oftener perhaps than we have declared, that she has no national poet—that each one of her
children of song has relied too much on European inspiration, and clung too fervently to the old
conventionalities. It is therefore not unlikely that she may believe in the dawn of a thoroughly
original literature, now there has arisen a man who scorns the Hellenic deities, who has no belief
in, perhaps because he has no knowledge of, Homer and

Shakspeare; who relies on his own rugged nature, and trusts to his own rugged language, being
himself what he shows in his poems. Once transfix him as the genesis of a new era, and the
manner of the man may be forgiven or forgotten. But what claim has this Walt Whitman to be
thus considered, or to be considered a poet at all? We grant freely enough that he has a strong
relish for nature and freedom, just as an animal has; may, further, that his crude mind is capable
of appreciating some of nature's beauties; but it by no means follows that, because nature is
excellent, therefore art is contemptible. Walt Whitman is as unacquainted with art, as a hog is
with mathematics. His poems—we must call them so for convenience—twelve in number, are
innocent of rhythm. and resemble nothing so much as the war-cry of the Red Indians. Indeed,
Walt Whitman has had near and ample opportunities of studying the vociferations of a few
amiable savages. Or rather, perhaps, this Walt Whitman reminds us of Caliban flinging down his
logs, and setting himself to write a poem. In fact, Caliban, and not Walt Whitman, might have
written this:</p>

                  <p class="tei_p">Is this man with the "barbaric yawp" to push Longfellow into the shade, and he meanwhile to
stand and "make mouths" at the sun? The chance of this might be formidable were it not
ridiculous. That object or that act which most develops the ridiculous element carries in its
bosom the seeds of decay, and is wholly powerless to trample out of God's universe one spark of
the beautiful. We do not, then, fear this Walt Whitman, who gives us slang in the place of
melody, and rowdyism in the place of regularity. The depth of his indecencies will be the grave
of his fame, or ought to be if all proper feeling is not extinct. The very nature of this man's
compositions excludes us from proving by extracts the truth of our remarks; but we, who are not
prudish, emphatically declare that the man who wrote page 79 of the "L<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">EAVES OF</span> G<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">RASS</span>"
deserves nothing so richly as the public executioner's whip. Walt Whitman libels the highest type
of humanity, and calls his free speech the true utterance of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">a man:</span> we, who may have
been misdirected by civilization, call it the expression of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">a beast</span>.</p>

last on earth will maintain also. He says:</p>

to suppose that Walt Whitman has been learning to write, and that the compositor has got hold of
his copy-book? The American critics are, in the main, pleased with this man because he is
self-reliant, and because he assumes all the attributes of his country. If Walt Whitman has really
assumed those attributes, America should hasten to repudiate them, be they what they may. The
critics are pleased also because he talks like a man unaware that there was ever such a production
as a book, or ever such a being as a writer. This in the present day is a qualification exceedingly
rare, and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">may</span> be valuable, so we wish those gentlemen joy of their G<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">REAT</span>

<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">has praised it,</span> and called it the "most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom America has
yet contributed." Because Emerson has grasped substantial fame, he can afford to be generous;
but Emerson's generosity must not be mistaken for justice. If this work is really a work of
genius—if the principles of those poems, their free language, their amazing and audacious
egotism, their animal vigor, be real poetry and the divinest evidence of the true poet—then our
studies have been in vain, and vainer still the homage which we have paid the monarchs of Saxon
intellect, Shakspeare, and Milton, and Byron. This Walt Whitman holds that his claim to be a
poet lies in his robust and rude health. He is, in fact, as he declares, "the poet of the body." Adopt
this theory, and Walt Whitman is a Titan; Shelley and Keats the merest pigmies. If we had
