               <span class="tei_l">Hours of the dusk, when I withdraw to a lonesome <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and unfrequented spot, seating myself, leaning <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>my face in my hands;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Hours sleepless, deep in the night, when I go forth,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>speeding swiftly the country roads, or through <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the city streets, or pacing miles and miles, sti-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>fling plaintive cries;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Hours discouraged, distracted—for the one I cannot <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>content myself without, soon I saw him content <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>himself without me;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Hours when I am forgotten, (O weeks and months are <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>passing, but I believe I am never to forget!)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Sullen and suffering hours! (I am ashamed—but it <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>is useless—I am what I am;)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Hours of my torment—I wonder if other men ever <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>have the like, out of the like feelings?</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Is there even one other like me—distracted—his <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>friend, his lover, lost to him?</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Is he too as I am now? Does he still rise in the morn-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ing, dejected, thinking who is lost to him? and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>at night, awaking, think who is lost?</span>
