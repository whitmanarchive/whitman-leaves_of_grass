               <span class="tei_l">L<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">ONG</span> I thought that knowledge alone would suffice <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>me—O if I could but obtain knowledge!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Then my lands engrossed me—Lands of the prairies,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>Ohio's land, the southern savannas, engrossed <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>me—For them I would live—I would be their <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>orator;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Then I met the examples of old and new heroes—I <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>heard of warriors, sailors, and all dauntless per-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>sons—And it seemed to me that I too had it <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>in me to be as dauntless as any—and would <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>be so;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And then, to enclose all, it came to me to strike up <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the songs of the New World—And then I be-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>lieved my life must be spent in singing;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">But now take notice, land of the prairies, land of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the south savannas, Ohio's land,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Take notice, you Kanuck woods—and you Lake <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>Huron—and all that with you roll toward <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>Niagara—and you Niagara also,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And you, Californian mountains—That you each <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and all find somebody else to be your singer of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>songs,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">For I can be your singer of songs no longer—One <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>who loves me is jealous of me, and withdraws me <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>from all but love,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">With the rest I dispense—I sever from what I <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>thought would suffice me, for it does not—it is <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>now empty and tasteless to me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I heed knowledge, and the grandeur of The States,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and the example of heroes, no more,</span>
