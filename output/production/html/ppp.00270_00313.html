               <h4 class="tei_head tei_head_type_main-authorial">WHEN I HEARD AT THE CLOSE OF THE DAY.</h4>

               <span class="tei_l">W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HEN</span> I heard at the close of the day how my name <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>had been receiv'd with plaudits in the capitol, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>still it was not a happy night for me that fol-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>low'd;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And else, when I carous'd, or when my plans were <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>accomplish'd, still I was not happy;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of per-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>fect health, refresh'd, singing, inhaling the ripe <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>breath of autumn,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>disappear in the morning light,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">When I wander'd alone over the beach, and undress-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ing, bathed, laughing with the cool waters, and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>saw the sun rise,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And when I thought how my dear friend, my lover, was <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>on his way coming, O then I was happy;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">O then each breath tasted sweeter—and all that day my <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>food nourish'd me more—and the beautiful day <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>pass'd well,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And the next came with equal joy—and with the next, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>at evening, came my friend;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And that night, while all was still, I heard the waters <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>roll slowly continually up the shores,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands, as <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>directed to me, whispering, to congratulate me,</span>

               <span class="tei_l">For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>same cover in the cool night,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">In the stillness, in the autumn moonbeams, his face was <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>inclined toward me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And his arm lay lightly around my breast—and that <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>night I was happy.</span>
