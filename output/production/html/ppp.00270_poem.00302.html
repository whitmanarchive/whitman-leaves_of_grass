            <span class="tei_l">M<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">Y</span> spirit to yours, dear brother;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Do not mind because many, sounding your name, do <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>not understand you;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">I do not sound your name, but I understand you, (there <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>are others also;)</span>
            <span class="tei_l">I specify you with joy, O my comrade, to salute you, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and to salute those who are with you, before and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>since—and those to come also,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">That we all labor together, transmitting the same <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>charge and succession;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">We few, equals, indifferent of lands, indifferent of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>times;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">We, enclosers of all continents, all castes—allowers of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>all theologies,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Compassionaters, perceivers, rapport of men,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">We walk silent among disputes and assertions, but <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>reject not the disputers, nor any thing that is <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>asserted;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">We hear the bawling and din—we are reached at by <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>divisions, jealousies, recriminations on every <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>side,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">They close peremptorily upon us, to surround us, my <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>comrade,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Yet we walk unheld, free, the whole earth over, jour-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>neying up and down, till we make our inefface-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>able mark upon time and the diverse eras,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Till we saturate time and eras, that the men and wo-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>men of races, ages to come, may prove brethren <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and lovers, as we are.</span>
