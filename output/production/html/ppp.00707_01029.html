                  <span class="tei_l">Far back, related on my mother's side,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Old Salt Kossabone, I'll tell you how he died:</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">(Had been a sailor all his life—was nearly 90—lived with his <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>married grandchild, Jenny;</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">House on a hill, with view of bay at hand, and distant cape, and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>stretch to open sea;)</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">The last of afternoons, the evening hours, for many a year his <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>regular custom,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">In his great arm chair by the window seated,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">(Sometimes, indeed, through half the day,)</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Watching the coming, going of the vessels, he mutters to himself <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>—And now the close of all:</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">One struggling outbound brig, one day, baffled for long—cross-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>tides and much wrong going,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">At last at nightfall strikes the breeze aright, her whole luck veer-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ing,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">And swiftly bending round the cape, the darkness proudly enter-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ing, cleaving, as he watches,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">"She's free—she's on her destination"—these the last words—<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>when Jenny came, he sat there dead,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Dutch Kossabone, Old Salt, related on my mother's side, far <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>back.</span>
