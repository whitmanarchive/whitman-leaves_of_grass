               <span class="tei_l">Come, I will take you down underneath this impassive <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>exterior—I will tell you what to say of me; </span>
               <span class="tei_l">Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the tenderest lover,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The friend, the lover's portrait, of whom his friend, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>his lover, was fondest,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who was not proud of his songs, but of the measure-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>less ocean of love within him—and freely <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>pour'd it forth,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who often walk'd lonesome walks, thinking of his <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>dear friends, his lovers,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who pensive, away from one he lov'd, often lay sleep-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>less and dissatisfied at night,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>he lov'd might secretly be indifferent to him,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Whose happiest days were far away, through fields, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>in woods, on hills, he and another, wandering <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>hand in hand, they twain, apart from other <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>men,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who oft as he saunter'd the streets, curved with his <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>arm the shoulder of his friend—while the arm <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>of his friend rested upon him also.</span>
