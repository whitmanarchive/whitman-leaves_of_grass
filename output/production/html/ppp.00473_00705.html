            <span class="tei_l tei_l_n_1">I <span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">NEED</span> no assurances—I am a man who is pre-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>occupied, of his own Soul;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">I do not doubt that from under the feet, and beside <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the hands and face I am cognizant of, are now <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>looking faces I am not cognizant of—calm and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>actual faces;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">I do not doubt but the majesty and beauty of the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>world are latent in any iota of the world;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">I do not doubt I am limitless, and that the universes <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>are limitless—in vain I try to think how limitless;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">I do not doubt that the orbs, and the systems of orbs, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>play their swift sports through the air on pur-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>pose—and that I shall one day be eligible to <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>do as much as they, and more than they;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">I do not doubt that temporary affairs keep on and on, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>millions of years;</span>

            <span class="tei_l">I do not doubt that the passionately-wept deaths of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>young men are provided for—and that the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>deaths of young women, and the deaths of little <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>children, are provided for;</span>
