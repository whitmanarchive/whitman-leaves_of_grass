               <span class="tei_l">I <span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HEAR</span> America singing, the varied carols I hear;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Those of mechanics—each one singing his, as it should <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>be, blithe and strong;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The carpenter singing his, as he measures his plank or <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>beam,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The mason singing his, as he makes ready for work, or <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>leaves off work;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat— <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the deck-hand singing on the steamboat deck;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench—the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>hatter singing as he stands;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The wood-cutter's song—the ploughboy's, on his way in <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the morning, or at the noon intermission, or at <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>sundown;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The delicious singing of the mother—or of the young <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>wife at work—or of the girl sewing or washing— <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>Each singing what belongs to her, and to none <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>else;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The day what belongs to the day—At night, the party <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>of young fellows, robust, friendly,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Singing, with open mouths, their strong melodious <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>songs.</span>
            </span>
