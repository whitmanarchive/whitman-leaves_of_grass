                  <span class="tei_l">The tables of population and products, I would sing of your ships <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and their cargoes,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">The proud black ships of Manhattan arriving, some fill'd with <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>immigrants, some from the isthmus with cargoes of gold,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Songs thereof would I sing, to all that hitherward comes would I <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>welcome give,</span>

                  <span class="tei_l">(Remember you surging Manhattan's crowds as you pass'd with <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>your cortege of nobles?</span>

                  <span class="tei_l">Of such, and fitful as they, I sing—with gleams from them would <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>I gleam and patch these chants,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Your chants, O year all mottled with evil and good—year of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>forebodings!</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Year of comets and meteors transient and strange—lo! even here <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>one equally transient and strange!</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">As I flit through you hastily, soon to fall and be gone, what is this <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>chant,</span>
