               <span class="tei_l">To me, all that those persons have arrived at, sinks <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>away from them, except as it results to their <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>Bodies and Souls,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">So that often to me they appear gaunt and naked;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And often, to me, each one mocks the others, and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>mocks himself or herself,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And of each one, the core of life, namely happiness, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>is full of the rotten excrement of maggots,</span>

               <span class="tei_l">And often, to me, they are alive after what custom has <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>served them, but nothing more,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And often, to me, they are sad, hasty, unwaked son- <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>nambules, walking the dusk.</span>
