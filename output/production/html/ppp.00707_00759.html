                     <span class="tei_l">But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>refresh'd, singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the morning light,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">When I wander'd alone over the beach, and undressing bathed,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>laughing with the cool waters, and saw the sun rise,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>coming, O then I was happy,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">O then each breath tasted sweeter, and all that day my food <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>nourish'd me more, and the beautiful day pass'd well,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">And the next came with equal joy, and with the next at evening <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>came my friend,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>continually up the shores,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>me whispering to congratulate me,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>in the cool night,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>toward me,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">And his arm lay lightly around my breast—and that night I was <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>happy.</span>
