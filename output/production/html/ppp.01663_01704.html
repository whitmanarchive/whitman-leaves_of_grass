               <span class="tei_l">O<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">NCE</span> I pass'd through a populous city imprinting my brain for <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>future use with its shows, architecture, customs, traditions,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Yet now of all that city I remember only a woman I casually met <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>there who detain'd me for love of me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Day by day and night by night we were together—all else has <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>long been forgotten by me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I remember I say only that woman who passionately clung to me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Again we wander, we love, we separate again,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Again she holds me by the hand, I must not go,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I see her close beside me with silent lips sad and tremulous.</span>
            </span>
