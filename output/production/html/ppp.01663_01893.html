               <h4 class="tei_head tei_head_type_main-authorial">THE OX-TAMER.</h4>
               <span class="tei_l">I<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">N</span> a far-away northern county in the placid pastoral region,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Lives my farmer friend, the theme of my recitative, a famous <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>tamer of oxen,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">There they bring him the three-year-olds and the four-year-olds to <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>break them,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">He will take the wildest steer in the world and break him and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>tame him,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">He will go fearless without any whip where the young bullock <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>chafes up and down the yard,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The bullock's head tosses restless high in the air with raging eyes,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Yet see you! how soon his rage subsides—how soon this tamer <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>tames him;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">See you! on the farms hereabout a hundred oxen young and old, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and he is the man who has tamed them,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">They all know him, all are affectionate to him;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">See you! some are such beautiful animals, so lofty looking;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Some are buff-color'd, some mottled, one has a white line running <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>along his back, some are brindled,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Some have wide flaring horns (a good sign)—see you! the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>bright hides,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">See, the two with stars on their foreheads—see, the round bodies <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and broad backs,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">How straight and square they stand on their legs—what fine <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>sagacious eyes!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">How they watch their tamer—they wish him near them—how <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>they turn to look after him!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">What yearning expression! how uneasy they are when he moves <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>away from them;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Now I marvel what it can be he appears to them, (books, politics, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>poems, depart—all else departs,)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I confess I envy only his fascination—my silent, illiterate friend,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Whom a hundred oxen love there in his life on farms,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">In the northern county far, in the placid pastoral region.</span>
            </span>
