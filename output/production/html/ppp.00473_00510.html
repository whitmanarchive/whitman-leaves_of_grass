               <span class="tei_l">You must be he I was seeking, or she I was seeking, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>(it comes to me, as of a dream,)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">All is recall'd as we flit by each other, fluid, affection-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ate, chaste, matured,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">You grew up with me, were a boy with me, or a girl <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>with me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I ate with you, and slept with you—your body has <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>become not yours only, nor left my body mine <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>only,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">You give me the pleasure of your eyes, face, flesh, as <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>we pass—you take of my beard, breast, hands, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>in return,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I am not to speak to you—I am to think of you when <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>I sit alone, or wake at night alone,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I am to wait—I do not doubt I am to meet you again,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I am to see to it that I do not lose you.</span>
