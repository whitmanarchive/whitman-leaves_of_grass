               <span class="tei_l">A<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">S</span> I lay with my head in your lap camerado,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The confession I made I resume, what I said to you and the open <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>air I resume,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I know I am restless and make others so,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I know my words are weapons full of danger, full of death,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">For I confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, to unsettle <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>them,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I am more resolute because all have denied me than I could ever <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>have been had all accepted me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I heed not and have never heeded either experience, cautions, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>majorities, nor ridicule,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And the threat of what is call'd hell is little or nothing to me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And the lure of what is call'd heaven is little or nothing to me;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Dear camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me, and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>still urge you, without the least idea what is our destination,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quell'd and defeated.</span>
            </span>
