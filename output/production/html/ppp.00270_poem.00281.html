            <span class="tei_l">Lo! <span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">THE</span> unbounded sea!</span>
            <span class="tei_l">On its breast a Ship starting, spreading all her sails— <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>an ample Ship, carrying even her moonsails;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">The pennant is flying aloft, as she speeds, she speeds <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>so stately—  below, emulous waves press forward,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">They surround the Ship, with shining curving motions, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and foam.</span>
