               <span class="tei_l">I<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">N</span> paths untrodden,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">In the growth by margins of pond-waters,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Escaped from the life that exhibits itself,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">From all the standards hitherto publish'd—from the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>pleasures, profits, eruditions, conformities,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Which too long I was offering to feed my soul;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Clear to me, now, standards not yet publish'd—clear to <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>me that my Soul,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">That the Soul of the man I speak for, feeds, rejoices <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>most in comrades;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Here, by myself, away from the clank of the world,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Tallying and talk'd to here by tongues aromatic,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">No longer abash'd—for in this secluded spot I can re-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>spond as I would not dare elsewhere,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Strong upon me the life that does not exhibit itself, yet <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>contains all the rest,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Resolv'd to sing no songs to-day but those of manly <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>attachment,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Projecting them along that substantial life,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Bequeathing, hence, types of athletic love,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Afternoon, this delicious Ninth-month, in my forty-first <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>year,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I proceed, for all who are, or have been, young men,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">To tell the secret of my nights and days,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">To celebrate the need of comrades.</span>
            </span>
