               I <span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HEAR</span> America singing, the varied carols I hear;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Those of mechanics—each one singing his, as it <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>should be, blithe and strong;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">The carpenter singing his, as he measures his plank <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>or beam,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">The mason singing his, as he makes ready for work, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>or leaves off work;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>—the deck-hand singing on the steamboat <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>deck;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench—the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>hatter singing as he stands;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">The wood-cutter's song—the ploughboy's, on his way <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>in the morning, or at the noon intermission, or <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>at sundown;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">The delicious singing of the mother—or of the young <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>wife at work—or of the girl sewing or washing <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>—Each singing what belongs to her, and to <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>none else;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">The day what belongs to the day—At night, the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>party of young fellows, robust, friendly,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Singing, with open mouths, their strong melodious <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>songs.</span>
