               <span class="tei_l">W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HEN</span> I heard at the close of the day how my name <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>had been received with plaudits in the capitol,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>still it was not a happy night for me that fol-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>lowed;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And else, when I caroused, or when my plans were <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>accomplished, still I was not happy;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>perfect health, refreshed, singing, inhaling the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ripe breath of autumn,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>disappear in the morning light,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">When I wandered alone over the beach, and, undress-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ing, bathed, laughing with the cool waters, and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>saw the sun rise,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And when I thought how my dear friend, my lover,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>was on his way coming, O then I was happy;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">O then each breath tasted sweeter—and all that day <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>my food nourished me more—And the beautiful <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>day passed well,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And the next came with equal joy—And with the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>next, at evening, came my friend;</span>

               <span class="tei_l">And that night, while all was still, I heard the waters <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>roll slowly continually up the shores,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>as directed to me, whispering, to congratulate <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>same cover in the cool night,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">In the stillness, in the autumn moonbeams, his face <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>was inclined toward me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And his arm lay lightly around my breast—And that <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>night I was happy.</span>
