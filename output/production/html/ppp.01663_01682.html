               <span class="tei_l">I <span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HEAR</span> America singing, the varied carols I hear,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and strong,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>work,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deck-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>hand singing on the steamboat deck,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>as he stands,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The wood-cutter's song, the ploughboy's on his way in the morn-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ing, or at noon intermission or at sundown,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>or of the girl sewing or washing,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The day what belongs to the day—at night the party of young <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>fellows, robust, friendly,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.</span>
            </span>
