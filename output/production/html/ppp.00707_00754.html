                  <span class="tei_lg tei_lg_type_linegroup">
                     <span class="tei_l">T<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HESE</span> I singing in spring collect for lovers,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">(For who but I should understand lovers and all their sorrow and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>joy?</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">And who but I should be the poet of comrades?)</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Collecting I traverse the garden the world, but soon I pass the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>gates,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Now along the pond-side, now wading in a little, fearing not the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>wet,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Now by the post-and-rail fences where the old stones thrown there,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>pick'd from the fields, have accumulated,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">(Wild-flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and partly cover them, beyond these I pass,)</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Far, far in the forest, or sauntering later in summer, before I think <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>where I go,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Solitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>silence,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Alone I had thought, yet soon a troop gathers around me,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Some walk by my side and some behind, and some embrace my <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>arms or neck,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">They the spirits of dear friends dead or alive, thicker they come,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>a great crowd, and I in the middle,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Collecting, dispensing, singing, there I wander with them,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Plucking something for tokens, tossing toward whoever is near me,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Here, lilac, with a branch of pine,</span>
                     <span class="hr">

                     <span class="tei_l">Here, out of my pocket, some moss which I pull'd off a live-oak <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>in Florida as it hung trailing down,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Here, some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">And here what I now draw from the water, wading in the pond-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>side,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">(O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me, and returns again <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>never to separate from me,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">And this, O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades, this <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>calamus-root shall,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Interchange it youths with each other! let none render it back!)</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">And twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">And stems of currants and plum-blows, and the aromatic cedar,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">These I compass'd around by a thick cloud of spirits,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Wandering, point to or touch as I pass, or throw them loosely <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>from me,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Indicating to each one what he shall have, giving something to <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>each;</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">But what I drew from the water by the pond-side, that I reserve,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">I will give of it, but only to them that love as I myself am capable <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>of loving.</span>
