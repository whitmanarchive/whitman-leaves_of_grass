               <span class="tei_l">You have explored the outward, the surface of the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>races—the life that has exhibited itself,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">You have treated man as the creature of politics,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>aggregates, rulers, and priests;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">But now I also, arriving, contribute something:</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I, an habitué of the Alleghanies, treat man as he is in <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the influences of Nature, in himself, in his own <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>inalienable rights,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Advancing, to give the spirit and the traits of new <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>Democratic ages, myself, personally,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">(Let the future behold them all in me—Me, so <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>puzzling and contradictory—Me, a Manhattan-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ese, the most loving and arrogant of men;)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I do not tell the usual facts, proved by records and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>documents,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">What I tell, (talking to every born American,)<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>requires no further proof than he or she who <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>will hear me, will furnish, by silently meditating <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>alone;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I press the pulse of the life that has hitherto seldom <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>exhibited itself, but has generally sought con-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>cealment, (the great pride of man, in himself,)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I illuminate feelings, faults, yearnings, hopes—I <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>have come at last, no more ashamed nor afraid;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Chanter of Personality, outlining a history yet to be,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I project the ideal man, the American of the future.</span>
