                     <span class="tei_l">F<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">AR</span> hence amid an isle of wondrous beauty,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Crouching over a grave an ancient sorrowful mother,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Once a queen, now lean and tatter'd seated on the ground,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Her old white hair drooping dishevel'd round her shoulders,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">At her feet fallen an unused royal harp,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Long silent, she too long silent, mourning her shrouded hope and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>heir,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow because most full of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>love.</span>
                  </span>
                  <span class="tei_lg tei_lg_type_linegroup">
                     <span class="tei_l">Yet a word ancient mother,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">You need crouch there no longer on the cold ground with fore-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>head between your knees,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">O you need not sit there veil'd in your old white hair so dishevel'd,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">For know you the one you mourn is not in that grave,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">It was an illusion, the son you love was not really dead,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">The Lord is not dead, he is risen again young and strong in <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>another country,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Even while you wept there by your fallen harp by the grave,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">What you wept for was translated, pass'd from the grave,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">The winds favor'd and the sea sail'd it,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">And now with rosy and new blood,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Moves to-day in a new country.</span>
                  </span>
