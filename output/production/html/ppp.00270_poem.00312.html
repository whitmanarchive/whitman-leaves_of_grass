               <span class="tei_l">Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the tenderest lover,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The friend, the lover's portrait, of whom his friend, his <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>lover, was fondest,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who was not proud of his songs, but of the measure-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>less ocean of love within him—and freely pour'd <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>it forth,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who often walk'd lonesome walks, thinking of his dear <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>friends, his lovers,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who pensive, away from one he lov'd, often lay sleep-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>less and dissatisfied at night,</span>

               <span class="tei_l">Who knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one he <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>lov'd might secretly be indifferent to him,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Whose happiest days were far away, through fields, in <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>woods, on hills, he and another, wandering hand <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>in hand, they twain, apart from other men,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who oft as he saunter'd the streets, curv'd with his <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>arm the shoulder of his friend—while the arm <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>of his friend rested upon him also.</span>
