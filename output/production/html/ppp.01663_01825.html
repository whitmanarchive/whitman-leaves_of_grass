               <h4 class="tei_head tei_head_type_main-authorial">VIGIL STRANGE I KEPT ON THE FIELD ONE NIGHT.</h4>
               <span class="tei_l">V<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">IGIL</span> strange I kept on the field one night;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">One look I but gave which your dear eyes return'd with a look I <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>shall never forget,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach'd up as you lay on <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>the ground,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Till late in the night reliev'd to the place at last again I made my <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>way,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>moderate night-wind,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the battle-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>field spreading,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>chin in my hands,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>comrade—not a tear, not a word,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>soldier,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>death,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>surely meet again,)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>appear'd,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his form,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and care-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>fully under feet,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>dim,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>responding,)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>brighten'd,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>blanket,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And buried him where he fell.</span>
            </span>
