               <span class="tei_lg tei_lg_type_linegroup">
                  <span class="tei_l">Or else by stealth in some wood for trial,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Or back of a rock in the open air,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">(For in any roof'd room of a house I emerge not, nor in com-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>pany,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">And in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,)</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">But just possibly with you on a high hill, first watching lest any <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>person for miles around approach unawares,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea or <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>some quiet island,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">With the comrade's long-dwelling kiss or the new husband's kiss,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">For I am the new husband and I am the comrade.</span>

                  <span class="tei_l">Or if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,</span>

                  <span class="tei_l">And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>eternally.</span>

                  <span class="tei_l">They will elude you at first and still more afterward, I will <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>certainly elude you,</span>

                  <span class="tei_l">For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>book,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>me,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Nor will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very few) <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>prove victorious,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Nor will my poems do good only, they will do just as much evil, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>perhaps more,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and not hit, that which I hinted at;</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Therefore release me and depart on your way.</span>
