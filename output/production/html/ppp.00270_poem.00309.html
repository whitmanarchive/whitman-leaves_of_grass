               <span class="tei_l">N<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">OT</span> heaving from my ribb'd breast only;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Not in sighs at night, in rage, dissatisfied with myself;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Not in those long-drawn, ill-supprest sighs;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Not in many an oath and promise broken;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Not in my wilful and savage soul's volition;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Not in the subtle nourishment of the air;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Not in this beating and pounding at my temples and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>wrists;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Not in the curious systole and diastole within, which <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>will one day cease;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Not in many a hungry wish, told to the skies only;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Not in cries, laughter, defiances, thrown from me when <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>alone, far in the wilds;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Not in husky pantings through clench'd teeth;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Not in sounded and resounded words—chattering words, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>echoes, dead words;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Not in the murmurs of my dreams while I sleep,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>every day;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Nor in the limbs and senses of my body, that take you <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and dismiss you continually—Not there;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Not in any or all of them, O adhesiveness! O pulse of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>my life!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Need I that you exist and show yourself, any more than <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>in these songs.</span>
            </span>
