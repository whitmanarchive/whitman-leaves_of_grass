               <h4 class="tei_head tei_head_type_main-authorial">SCENTED HERBAGE OF MY BREAST.</h4>
               <span class="tei_l">S<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">CENTED</span> herbage of my breast,</span> 
               <span class="tei_l">Leaves from you I glean, I write, to be perused best afterwards,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Tomb-leaves, body-leaves growing up above me above death,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Perennial roots, tall leaves, O the winter shall not freeze you <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>delicate leaves,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Every year shall you bloom again, out from where you retired you <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>shall emerge again;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">O I do not know whether many passing by will discover you or <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>inhale your faint odor, but I believe a few will;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">O slender leaves! O blossoms of my blood! I permit you to tell <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>in your own way of the heart that is under you,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">O I do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves, you <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>are not happiness,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">You are often more bitter than I can bear, you burn and sting me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Yet you are beautiful to me you faint tinged roots, you make me <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>think of death,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Death is beautiful from you, (what indeed is finally beautiful except <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>death and love?)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my chant of lovers, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>I think it must be for death,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">For how calm, how solemn it grows to ascend to the atmosphere <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>of lovers,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Death or life I am then indifferent, my soul declines to prefer,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">(I am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most,)</span>   
               <span class="tei_l">Indeed O death, I think now these leaves mean precisely the same <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>as you mean,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Grow up taller sweet leaves that I may see! grow up out of my <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>breast!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Spring away from the conceal'd heart there!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Do not fold yourself so in your pink-tinged roots timid leaves!</span>
               <span class="hr">

               <span class="tei_l">Do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my breast!</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Come I am determin'd to unbare this broad breast of mine, I <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>have long enough stifled and choked;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Emblematic and capricious blades I leave you, now you serve me <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>not,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I will say what I have to say by itself,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I will sound myself and comrades only, I will never again utter a <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>call only their call,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I will raise with it immortal reverberations through the States,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>will through the States,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Give me your tone therefore O death, that I may accord with it,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Give me yourself, for I see that you belong to me now above all, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and are folded inseparably together, you love and death are,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I was calling life,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">For now it is convey'd to me that you are the purports essential,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">That you hide in these shifting forms of life, for reasons, and that <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>they are mainly for you,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">That you beyond them come forth to remain, the real reality,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">That behind the mask of materials you patiently wait, no matter <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>how long,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">That you will one day perhaps take control of all,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">That you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">That may-be you are what it is all for, but it does not last so very <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>long,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">But you will last very long.</span>
