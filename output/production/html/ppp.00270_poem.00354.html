               <span class="tei_l">As I lay with my head in your lap, Camerado,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The confession I made I resume—what I said to you <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>and the open air I resume:</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I know I am restless, and make others so;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I know my words are weapons, full of danger, full of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>death;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">(Indeed I am myself the real soldier:</span>
               <span class="tei_l">It is not he, there, with his bayonet, and not the red-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>striped artilleryman;)</span>
               <span class="tei_l">For I confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>to unsettle them;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I am more resolute because all have denied me, than I <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>could ever have been had all accepted me;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I heed not, and have never heeded, either experience, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>cautions, majorities, nor ridicule;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And the threat of what is call'd hell is little or nothing <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>to me;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And the lure of what is call'd heaven is little or nothing <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>to me;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">…Dear camerado! I confess I have urged you onward <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>with me, and still urge you, without the least <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>idea what is our destination,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quell'd and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>defeated.</span>
            </span>
