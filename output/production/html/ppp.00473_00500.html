               <span class="tei_l">When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>disappear in the morning light,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">When I wander'd alone over the beach, and undress-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ing, bathed, laughing with the cool waters, and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>saw the sun rise,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And when I thought how my dear friend, my lover, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>was on his way coming, O then I was happy; </span>
               <span class="tei_l">O then each breath tasted sweeter—and all that day <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>my food nourish'd me more—and the beautiful <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>day pass'd well,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And the next came with equal joy—and with the next, <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>at evening, came my friend; </span>
               <span class="tei_l">And that night, while all was still, I heard the waters <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>roll slowly continually up the shores,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands, as <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>directed to me, whispering, to congratulate me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>same cover in the cool night,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">In the stillness, in the autumn moonbeams, his face <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>was inclined toward me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">And his arm lay lightly around my breast—and that <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>night I was happy.</span>
