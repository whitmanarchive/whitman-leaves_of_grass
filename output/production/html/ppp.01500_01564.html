               <span class="tei_l">We become plants, leaves, foliage, roots, bark,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are bedded in the ground—we are rocks,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are oaks—we grow in the openings side by side,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We browse—we are two among the wild herds,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>spontaneous as any,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are two fishes swimming in the sea together,</span>

               <span class="tei_l">around the lanes, mornings and evenings,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are also the coarse smut of beasts, vegetables,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>minerals,</span>

               <span class="tei_l">We are what the flowing wet of the Tennessee is—<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>we are two peaks of the Blue Mountains, rising <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>up in Virginia,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are two predatory hawks—we soar above and <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>look down,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are two resplendent suns—we it is who balance <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>ourselves orbic and stellar—we are as two <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>comets;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We prowl fanged and four-footed in the woods—we <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>spring on prey;</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are two clouds, forenoons and afternoons, driving <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>overhead,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are seas mingling—we are two of those cheerful <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>waves, rolling over each other, and interwetting <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>each other,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are what the atmosphere is, transparent, receptive,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>pervious, impervious,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We are snow, rain, cold, darkness—we are each <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>product and influence of the globe,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We have circled and circled till we have arrived <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>home again—we two have,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">We have voided all but freedom, and all but our <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>own joy.</span>
