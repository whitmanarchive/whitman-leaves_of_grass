               <span class="tei_l">Come, I will take you down underneath this impassive exterior, I <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>will tell you what to say of me,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>lover,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">The friend the lover's portrait, of whom his friend his lover was <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>fondest,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who was not proud of his songs, but of the measureless ocean of <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>love within him, and freely pour'd it forth,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who often walk'd lonesome walks thinking of his dear friends, his <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>lovers,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who pensive away from one he lov'd often lay sleepless and dissat-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>isfied at night,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one he lov'd <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>might secretly be indifferent to him,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Whose happiest days were far away through fields, in woods, on <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>hills, he and another wandering hand in hand, they twain <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>apart from other men,</span>
               <span class="tei_l">Who oft as he saunter'd the streets curv'd with his arm the shoul <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>der of his friend, while the arm of his friend rested upon <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>him also.</span>
