                     <span class="tei_l">P<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">ENSIVE</span> on her dead gazing I heard the Mother of All,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Desperate on the torn bodies, on the forms covering the battle-<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>fields gazing,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">(As the last gun ceased, but the scent of the powder-smoke <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>linger'd,)</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">As she call'd to her earth with mournful voice while she stalk'd,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Absorb them well O my earth, she cried, I charge you lose not <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>my sons, lose not an atom,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">And you streams absorb them well, taking their dear blood,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">And you local spots, and you airs that swim above lightly <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>impalpable,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">And all you essences of soil and growth, and you my rivers' depths,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">And you mountain sides, and the woods where my dear children's <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>blood trickling redden'd,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">And you trees down in your roots to bequeath to all future trees,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">My dead absorb or South or North—my young men's bodies <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>absorb, and their precious precious blood,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Which holding in trust for me faithfully back again give me many <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>a year hence,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">In unseen essence and odor of surface and grass, centuries hence,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">In blowing airs from the fields back again give me my darlings,<span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>give my immortal heroes,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Exhale me them centuries hence, breathe me their breath, let not <span class="before_br"> </span><br><span class="after_br"> </span>an atom be lost,</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">O years and graves! O air and soil! O my dead, an aroma sweet!</span>
                     <span class="tei_l">Exhale them perennial sweet death, years, centuries hence.</span>
